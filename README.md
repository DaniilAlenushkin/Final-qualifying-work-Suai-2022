# Research on the effectiveness of the use of LDPC codes in shortwave radio communication systems
Graduate work of a bachelor.

**University**: Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation.

**Year**: 2022.

**Specialty**: Infocommunication technologies and communication systems.

**The purpose of the work**: to study the possibility of using LDPC codes in channels with a high probability of bit error, such as a shortwave radio channel. 

**Work tasks**:

1. Analyze LDPC codes.
2. Programmatically implement algorithms for encoding and decoding LDPC codes.
3. Conduct simulation to provide a comparative analysis of the concatenated Reed-Solomon code as an external and Golay code as an internal and LDPC code with
similar sizes of information and code blocks.

**The object of investigation**: A code with a low density of parity checks is a code used in information transmission, 
a special case of a block linear code with parity check. A feature is the low density of significant elements of the check matrix, due to which the relative simplicity of the implementation of coding tools is achieved.

**Why it is important?** To check the possibility of using the LDPC code in non-stationary channels with a higher probability of a bit error, it is necessary to conduct a comparative analysis of LDPC codes and codes actually used in shortwave data transmission systems.

**Main conclusions**: LDPC code, at the considered code rates, showed less corrective ability, in communication channels in which the probability of error per bit reaches 0.1, which alone, which as an external stage of the concatenated code, in comparison with the concatenated code, where in the Reed Solomon code (170, 136, 25) is used as the outer one, and the Golay code (24, 12, 8) is used as the inner one. LDPC code is applicable in communication channels with a lower bit error probability. LDPC code is applicable where it is required to transfer information of large sizes.
